United States Cancer and Heart Disease Choropleth Maps

I created choropleth maps in Python using Plotly, depicting state-level cancer and heart disease age-adjusted death rates. These maps were
part of a bigger group project analyzing general U.S. health trends. An example of one of my cancer age-adjusted death rate maps can be found here: https://plot.ly/create/?fid=eyangeric:4#/. One of my maps for heart disease can be found here: 
https://plot.ly/create/?fid=eyangeric:8#/.
